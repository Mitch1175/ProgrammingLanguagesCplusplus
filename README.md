#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to construct a clock that showed both 12-hour and 24-hour times. The user will then be able to add 1 hour, 1 minute, 1 second, or quit to the clocks.

#What did you do particularly well?
I liked how I configured the interface. I was able to make a design using a (* and -) pattern.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code by adding more classes that do different things. This would help the flow and allow it to run faster. I could then make additions to the clock to make it more complicated.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging code was learning which places to include the code into my "while" statement. Some pieces were not able to be included or it would loop infinitely. I was able to use the SNHU tutoring and read an extra book I purchased.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills that can be transferable is ability to write a simple program. I can use this as a baseline to add more complicated code such as calculations, a more intense interface, or even a game.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I put notes in each part of the program so that it would be easy to read. I made sure to use white space and indents to make the code readable and easy to comprehend.
